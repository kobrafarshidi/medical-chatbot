medical chatbot with LLM models without needed api_key

This source code is a simple graphical medical chatbot program.
Pay attention some points:
1) This program uses LLM models but maybe you don't access to api_key, so this program provides you to use these popular LLM in the form of offline
2) Since the format of datasets in this field (medical QA) is in 'json' so I attached a dataset.json as an example of a very simple dataset.
